            <h1> Electrostatic Discharge </h1>
            <p> ESD is when static electricity is released because of two different electrically charged objects that come into contact with each other or when the dielectric between them breaks down. A person can feel ESD when at least 3,000 volts of static electricity is built up which can be caused by tribocharging. </p>
            <p> ESD equipment works to actively neutralize the threat posed by static electricity by working to prevent ESD events, safely discharge static charges and, protect the environment and everything therein. It can cause damage to computer equipment or electronic components, especially integrated circuits and microchips, if not discharged properly. </p>
