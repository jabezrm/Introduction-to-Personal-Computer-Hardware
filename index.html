    <h1> INTRODUCTION TO <br> PERSONAL COMPUTER HARDWARE </h1>
    <p>  A personal computer (PC) is a computer for personal use. PCs are typically used for a number of tasks, <br> including the execution of software applications,
        viewing the internet, creating and editing documents, playing games, <br> and more. There are different components behind a computer which will be discussed in this website.

            <p> Computers have a range of hardware components, including a processor, memory, storage, and input/output devices. The processor, commonly known as the CPU, is the computer's brain, which is in charge of executing instructions and calculations. Memory, also known as RAM, is used to store data while the processor is working on it temporarily. In contrast, storage, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive, is used to store data permanently. To communicate with the computer and examine the results of its processes, input/output devices are employed. PCs also have an operating system which controls the hardware.</p>
            <p> In short, a computer is a versatile and powerful instrument that may be used for various reasons, from productivity to leisure. A PC may be customized to match the demands of practically any user with the correct hardware and software.
