            <h1> 1. Input Devices </h1>
            <p> Any hardware component that enables a user to enter information and commands into a computer is referred to as an input device. The keyboard, mouse, touchpad, scanner, microphone, and camera are a few examples of input devices. These tools are used to record and transform physical or acoustic signals into digital data that a computer can process. </p>

            <h1> 2. Output Devices </h1>
            <p> An output device is a piece of equipment or hardware that gives out the processed results of the input that was entered. It takes binary information from computer and converts it into a form that is easily understood by the user. Some examples of these include monitor, projector, printer, headphones, speakers, etc. </p>

            <h1> 3. Central Processing Unit </h1>
            <p> The CPU, also known as the processor is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to interpret and carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an application, you're sending instructions to the CPU. The CPU loads information from the RAM and processes it to perform the tasks required from the computer.  </p>
            <p> Processors are usually differentiated by their speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz). The computer will operate more quickly when the GHz is higher. The more powerful and updated your processor, the faster your computer can complete its tasks and optimize the power of the RAM you have. However, more than just the processor, the several different components also play a role in the actual speed of the computer. </p>

    <h1> 4. Computer Memory </h1>
    <p> All memory chips store data in form of bytes (block of eight bits stored as either 0 or 1 in the memory chip). It is used to store data/information <br> and instructions for immediate use. It can store both the input and output. There are two types of computer memory which are shown below. </p>

                <li> It is semiconductor memories. </li>
                <li> It is usually a volatile memory. </li>
                <li> A computer system cannot run without primary memory. </li>

                <li> Data accessing speed is slower than main memory. </li>
                <li> These are magnetic and optical memories. </li>
                <li> It is a non-volatile memory. </li>

            <h3> RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
            <p> RAM, measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB), is a short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it. This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. RAM gives your system more available space to temporarily store data that's being used. So, it helps you carry out simultaneous tasks, such as having several tabs open while surfing the web without long load times. That is why when there are numerous apps running on the computer, it could be slow if there is not enough RAM. The speed of the RAM is a big contributor to the overall speed of a computer. </p>

        <div class = "grid-col">
            <img src = "images/rom.jpg">
            <h3> ROM (Read Only Memory)</h3>
            <p> ROM is used to store permanent information. It is also non-volatile which means its contents are stored even if the device is turned off. The processor canâ€™t directly access the information that is stored in the ROM. In order to access ROM information first, the information is transferred into the RAM, and then it can be executed by the processor. ROM allows user to read information, but it does not allow data stored on them to be modified. </p>

    <h1> 5. Storage Devices </h1>
    <p> Storage device is any type of computing hardware that is used for storing, porting or extracting data files and objects. Storage devices can hold and store information both temporarily
        and permanently. They may be internal or external to a computer, server or computing device. Data storage devices can be classified according to the media on which the data is stored such as the following.

            <h3> Magnetic </h3>
            <p> This storage device uses a magnetization process to write, rewrite and access data. It is covered with a magnetic coating and stores data in the form of tracks, spots,
                and sectors. Hard disks, zip disks and floppy disks are common examples of magnetic disks.

            <h3> Solid State </h3>
            <p> This non-volatile storage media stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. SSDs replace traditional hard disk drives in computers and performs the same basic
                functions as a hard drive. Without devices like HDDs that can retain data after they have been turned off, computer users would not be able to store programs or save files or documents to their computers.

    <p> Cases keep the internal components of a personal computer such as power supply, motherboard, CPU, disk drives, and assorted adapter cards. It holds and protects all of the important parts of a PC or other computing device. PC cases come with a plethora of stylish features, such as tempered glass panels, hinged or screw doors, noise-dampening, and LED lighting, and are constructed from a variety of different materials. Along with all of this, PC cases come in a variety of different sizes to suit everyone.
        The term Form Factor refers to the physical design and look of a case. Below are the most common form factors. </p>

            <h1> 7. Power Supplies </h1>
            <p> An electronic device known as a power supply transforms AC (alternating current) electricity from a source, such as the electrical grid or a generator, into the DC (direct current) electricity required to operate a computer's or other device's internal components. The voltage and current provided to the system are controlled by a power supply unit (PSU), which also protects against power surges and voltage variations. It is an important part that connects to the motherboard, hard drive, and other internal components, and it gives the computer the right kind and amount of electricity. </p>

            <h1> 8. Connectors and Ports </h1>
            <p> The main function of a computer port is to act as a point of attachment, where the cable from the peripheral can be plugged in and allows data to flow from and to the device. It is a connection point or interface between a computer and an external or internal device. Internal ports may connect such devices as hard drives and CD ROM or DVD drives; external ports may connect modems, printers, mice and other devices. </p>

            <p> An adapter card is a piece of hardware that you install in the motherboard to increase its functionality. Adapter cards can upgrade the components and increase a computer's functionality by adding controllers for specific devices or by replacing malfunctioning ports. Some examples are network cards, sound cards, graphics cards, TV tuner cards, and USB cards. </p>
